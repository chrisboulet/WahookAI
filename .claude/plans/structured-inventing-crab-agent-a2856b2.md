# Research Plan: B2B Subscription Pricing for Coffee Service Business

## Research Objective
Find academic papers, validated methodologies, and industry best practices for B2B subscription/recurring service pricing, specifically applicable to a coffee service business model with three components:
1. **Consumables** - Coffee per cup (per-unit consumption)
2. **Service visits** - Frequency-based maintenance/restocking
3. **Equipment** - Vending machines/coffee makers (amortized over 12 months)

## Research Questions

### 1. Coffee Service & Vending Machine Pricing Models

- What are the behavioral economics considerations for consumption-based pricing?

### 3. Equipment Leasing Amortization
- What are validated formulas for amortizing equipment costs into service contracts?
- How do businesses balance equipment depreciation with contract length?
- What are best practices for embedding capital equipment costs in recurring service fees?

### 4. Service Frequency Pricing Optimization
- How do companies price service visits (daily, weekly, monthly)?

- How does visit frequency affect customer value perception?

### 5. B2B Subscription Pricing Frameworks
- What academic frameworks exist for B2B subscription pricing?
- How do successful B2B subscription businesses structure multi-component pricing?
- What are the psychological and economic principles behind subscription pricing?
