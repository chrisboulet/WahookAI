# Apprentissage Automatique - 2026-01-11

## Points Clés (Haute Confiance)

### CAPTURE

WahookAI has successfully forked from PAI v2 and evolved into KAI with custom branding, 20 packs, project-specific skills, observability dashboard, and voice integration. Upstream changes since migration are primarily documentation improvements and minor pack refinements. The system is stable and doesn't require updates unless specific features are desired.
